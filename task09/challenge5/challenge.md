**Challenge**:
Your goal is to center an image on a page that can be changed randomly by either pressing a key or clicking on it. The image will come from a random selection, but you must find a way to create a set of images to pull from. Make it your own and use your own images! (You can upload them to sites such as Imgur to include them in the site).

 - Use event listeners & the event object
 - Use arrays & objects to store image data
 - Remember to include alt tags!

**Topics Covered:**
 - Event listeners
 - Key codes

 - Flexbox

**Extra Challenge**:
Get creative & add some styling to the images.
